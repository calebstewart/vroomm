// guiCmd represents the gui command
var guiCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "gui",
	Short: "GTK-based Graphical Virtual Machine Manager",
	Long: `Opens the virtual machine manager as a graphical GTK3-based application.
The application optionally supports wlr-layer-shell protocols through gtk-layer-shell,
and is primarily intended to be used in this way (i.e. as a pop-up VM manager
integrated in your DE as a keyboard shortcut).

The interface is very similar to tools like Dmenu, Rofi or Wofi, and should be
relatively intuitive. Typing will always focus the text input with the exception
of the up/down arrows which select items in the appropriate menu, the enter key
which accepts the current menu or item selection, and escape. Escape alone will
navigate backwards through the menu tree. Pressing Shift+Escape will exit the
application immediately.

This application was built for my own use, and is not heavily tested. If you
don't know what you're doing with low-level libvirt interaction, it is not
recommended to blindly click items in the interface. There are very few
confirmations as the interface assumes you know what you're doing. Good luck.
